<h1>The vision behind Express24clean</h1>

<p>I started Express24clean with a vision to improve living and working environments across Lagos by offering the best cleaning services in the industry. The company has been built around the needs of our customers and understanding how we can help them to make a difference in their lives.</p>

<p>First and foremost, here at  Express24clean, we make sure we hire the best and most experienced cleaners who enjoy and excel at their job. I personally screen and interview all cleaners applying for a job with us. All cleaners have to pass our internal skills test.</p>

<p>We carefully check identification, and collect references before we look whether the candidate has the right personality and set of skills for the job. New cleaners initially work alongside one of our supervisors or they are tested by cleaning one of the homes of our management team.</p><br><br><br>

<h1>What we do?</h1>

<p>
We offer professional cleaning services including domestic and commercial cleaning services to customers across Lagos. We specialized in office cleaning, domestic cleaning, end of tenancy cleaning, deep cleaning, carpet cleaning and after-building cleaning. Our certified operatives also offer antiviral disinfection services.</p>

<h1>Our approach</h1>
<p>
I believe that appreciation and gratitude help in enhancing the performance of cleaning staff. I apply this belief on the appointed cleaners. My goal was to create a positive experience for staff, which would stimulate learning and continuous improvement. I strive to offer support to our cleaners at all times and be understanding towards them even in the case when there are some shortcomings. I treat all of them with kindness and, if necessary, try to make them understand that their performance has not been up to the mark. In addition to this, I provide them with suggestions to improve their performance.</p>


<P>From the very beginning, I decided that providing training was important despite the business having no funds for a training budget. Some cleaners say that I am very demanding, but I believe it is important for cleaners to receive regular, constructive feedback about their work, as this is the only way to improve standards and customer satisfaction. I always try to find an individual approach to each of the cleaning operatives and understand their family problems, health issues and life changes.</P>


<h1>How we started</h1>

<p>
I developed an idea to start a cleaning business after I spent a few years cleaning properties in the Alimosho Area of Lagos. Having acquired new skills I was learning about the most efficient cleaning methods over these years and my schedule was always full of more customers asking for more of my time. Although I was very happy with my jobs I was aware of the reality in the cleaning industry. Cleaners had to face low pay and unsatisfying work conditions regardless of cleaner’s experience or type of work, which in return led to low staff morale and a decrease in productivity. I did not create a professional cleaning company overnight, it was a lot of effort to get where we are now.</p>

<p>
I decided to create a better company, which would care about all staff offering Lagos Living Wage to tackle low morale and motivation. It took me a lot of sleepless nights to create a reputable company providing professional cleaning services, however, our approach significantly improved quality and customer satisfaction.  The idea has turned into a success, with more and more customers were signing up for the services every day over the past 5 years. Recommendations have spread through friends and family of our existing customers, which I find to be the best testimony of our quality and reliability. Express24clean is steadily growing – and I am excited to say we are just getting started! .</p>
