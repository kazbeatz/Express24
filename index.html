           <p>  Office cleaning gives a good first impression to your customers and visitors, as well as enhancing your staff’s physical and emotional wellbeing. Reducing allergens, dust, and mould makes your team healthier and more productive.</p>

          <p> Our research showed that many office customers wanted to switch because their previous cleaners performed an unsatisfactory job, neglecting some key areas. We always aim to raise the standard for our office clients and that’s why many of them remain with us for years!</p>

            <p> Our professional office cleaning staff, vetted, trained and supported by our experienced management team will be pleased to help and take away the hassle away from you, so that your staff can stay healthy and concentrate on their work.</p>

          <p>We are also offering Office Deep Cleaning services to help fight against the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>It is of the highest priority to have a clean and healthy environment for our children. That is why here at Express24clean we have trained our cleaners to perform school cleaning services to the highest standard. There are all sorts of nasty bacteria that can be of danger to children, therefore it is vital that the environment is sanitized regularly.</p>



<p> All of our cleaners are interviewed in person, tested and fully-vetted by our founder before they are offered one-to-one training by one of our supervisors. Only when we are confident in our new cleaners we start allocating them to the jobs.</p>

<h4>Economical and Safe School Cleaning Services</h4>

<p>At Cleaning Express we clean schools and educational bodies of all sizes including nurseries, pre-schools, primary schools, secondary schools, colleges, universities and city academies. An educational setting whether it is a school or university requires a high standard of cleaning and trustworthy, reliable cleaners are essential. We know that every school, college or university is different and we take time to draw an individual plan to cover every aspect of our work before we start cleaning.</p>

<p>Child protection is of paramount importance to us and we use designated cleaners for nursery and school cleaning. We tailor our cleaning rotas around the requirements of your school meaning that your staff and pupils will not be affected by the cleaning taking place. We also offer handyman services, painting, decorating & deep clean services during holidays.</p>

<p>We follow governments advice on coronavirus and our staff have strict COVID-19 guidelines on following social distancing, keeping the surfaces clean and self-isolating if necessary. </p>

               <p>1. Regular cleaning during school term</p>
               <p>2. Communal area cleaning</p>
               <p>3. Antiviral disinfection (sanitisation)</p>

<p>We can also supply your school with various janitorial supplies and consumables. We use safe cleaning products, however, we can accommodate changes to the materials if other products will need to be used because of allergies.</p>

Offices & staff rooms
Reception areas
Assembly rooms, auditoriums and sports halls
